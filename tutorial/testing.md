# Testing: The test runner

The test runner is not yet implemented. It's still but a concept for future
iterations of this class; we could potentially have an object that monitors
a simulation and has advance knowledge of "ideal" performance, thus comparing
actual performance to ideal performance and "autograding" or showing the 
student how close to within limits they may be in their parameter tuning.
