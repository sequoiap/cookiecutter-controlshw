## Introduction

Welcome to the controls cookiecutter, designed for BYU's ECEN 483 course!

This course is designed for students from both BYU's Mechanical Engineering and
Electrical Engineering departments. However, student's levels of experience
with coding languages vary greatly between the two departments; Mechanical
Engineering students tend to be very proficient with MATLAB, while Electrical
Engineering students tend to be comfortable with C or C++. Oftentimes it is the
case that neither group is particularly knowledgeable about Python. While it is
hoped that through this course you can learn Python to a reasonable degree,
this is not a programming course, it is a controls course, and the objective is
to learn the design of control systems. Therefore, this cookiecutter is
provided to give you a template from which to begin--the framework for all the
simulations in this class are provided here. 

In addition, this tutorial aims walk you through all the different libraries
required in this class and give you the confidence to navigate through the
project knowing how all the files interact, how to create graphs that reveal
how your system is performing, etc.

I know that reading documentation can be particularly boring. Rude! I think I'm
actually pretty funny! But, to try to make this tutorial a little more
enticing, I've included plenty of things for you to try or do on each page to
help yourself get a little more hands-on experience and intuition that I
believe you'll need to successfully get through all the code in this course and
actually understand what you're doing. When you see a code snippet or other
instructions, try it out! Reading is one thing; you'll never really remember it
unless you've done it yourself.

Good luck!

## Note to Maintainers

This tutorial is comprised of several markdown files contained within the same
directory. The files conform to a general template (see
[template.md](template.md)) where each page links to the home page, the
previous topic, and the next topic. Therefore, should pages be added in the
future, it is simple to add within the home page's table of contents and
changing links in the page previous and following where the new page is
inserted.
