## Running Simulations from the Toplevel

Make sure your conda environment is activated.

You can run simulations by navigating to the appropriate folder and running, in
a terminal (after activating your environment):

```
python sim.py
```

Or, you can run them in VSCode using the "Run" button, see the 
[tutorial](https://github.com/sequoiap/cookiecutter-controlshw/blob/autograde/tutorial/README.md).
